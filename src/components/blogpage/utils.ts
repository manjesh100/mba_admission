      blogDescription: "<p>Do you dream of following the advice of Sebastian and exploring life &ldquo;under the sea&rdquo;? As the beloved crab from The Little Mermaid told Ariel, &ldquo;such wonderful things surround you&rdquo; in the ocean. <br /><br />And if you study marine biology, you&rsquo;ll learn about all the creatures, environment, and life in the sea. The science discipline draws numerous future marine biologists every year. Are you interested in exploring the world of water? If so, check out these 20 top schools for the major.</p><p><br /><strong>How We Made This List</strong></p><p>This list is based on several factors, including the reputation of the program, the median earnings of graduates of the major, the popularity of the marine biology major with the institution, the size of the program relative to the size of the school, and the student-faculty ratio at the larger institution.</p><p><strong>What Are Your Chances of Acceptance to these Top Marine Biology Schools?</strong></p><p>Many of the colleges and universities on this list are highly selective, and others still have competitive marine biology programs. How do you know your chances of admission? Try our free chancing engine. We&rsquo;ll estimate your odds of acceptance at these and other schools, using your real data. Plus, we&rsquo;ll offer tips to help you improve your profile.</p><br/><p><strong>The Do&rsquo;s for the &ldquo;Why Major&rdquo; Essay</strong></p><p><strong>Do tell a story and include personal details</strong></p><p>This list is based on several factors, including the reputation of the program, the median earnings of graduates of the major, the popularity of the marine biology major with the institution, the size of the program relative to the size of the school, and the student-faculty ratio at the larger institution.</p><p><strong>Do talk about specific areas of interest and goals</strong></p><p>Make sure to talk about where your interest came from and how it has developed during your academics and extracurriculars. The most impactful essays tell a story. Keep in mind, however, that this &ldquo;why major&rdquo; essay should not be a resume, so refrain from listing every single extracurricular activity that relates to your chosen major. Admission officers have already seen all of your extracurriculars from your Common App, and instead are hoping to understand your personal connection to your intended major.<br /><br />Another way to make your &ldquo;why major&rdquo; essay stand out in this way is to emphasize your goals for the future. Once you have crafted your narrative and clearly explained your passion for the major, it can be helpful for the admissions officers to have an idea of what your goals are and how majoring in this field is going to help you achieve them. For example, if your goal is to find success as an author of numerous culturally relevant novels, studying great works of literature through an English major is a clear path to this.&nbsp;</p>",
